This repo provides an overview of Apanga's
upcoming changes, including major milestones,
minor enhancements, and bugs.

Feel free to submit or comment on issues here.

## Submitting a bug report

Please describe how to reproduce the bug if
you know how; or say that you don't if not.
Screenshots are awesome when they help describe
what's happening. Crash reports are also awesome.

Please prioritize the bug using the system below.

## Issue priorities

* **P0** Shit hit fan.
* **P1** Bad; fix quickly.
* **P2** Needs to be fixed soonish.
* **P3** Good to fix, not critical.
* **P4** Optional.

Examples:

* No one can log in is a **P0**.
* The framerate dropped to 30 is a **P1**. (Should be 60 fps.)
* Other players are always viewed with 1 sec latency is a **P2**. (Should be lower latency.)
* Emoticons in player names don't display correctly is a **P3**.
* Your character looks ugly is a **P4**.

## Next milestone

The next major feature will be the release of a windows
version. This is scheduled to be released to testers
on [300.2014](http://tylerneylon.com/a/7date/) = May 28.

## Major game events and version numbers

Apanga will evolve as an alpha, beta, and a release version.

* **alpha** = unstable; `v0.*`
* **beta** = fun and unstable; `v1.*`
* **release** = fun and stable; `v2+`

Not all milestones have corresponding issues in the
issue tracker; instead, enhancement issues tend to focus on smaller steps
that make up the milestones.
